# IBM Courier

## Introduction

In 1989, IBM contributed PostScript versions of the basic IBM Courier family to the X Consortium.
These original files are still available and can be freely downloaded, but they can be hard to find.
So I tracked them down and wrote a script to convert them into a new package of OTFs, TTFs, and webfonts.

## Build

```bash
$ ./build.sh
$ ls dist/*.zip
dist/Courier.zip
```
